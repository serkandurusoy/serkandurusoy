## Hello GitHub 👋

Apart from a full time 🎅 senior engineering leader role, I'm taking my ⏳ time to imagine - _perhaps begin developing_ - a side project as an indie product that would help make ⛵ sailing more accessible to people who dream a life at 🌊 sea but can't take that leap of faith for whatever - _mostly 💰 financial_ - reason.

If, by any chance you are 👀 a designer, product manager or developer who has a passion for sailing, better yet are a digital nomad enjoying a 🚣‍♀️ liveaboard life, please say 👋 hi!
